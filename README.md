# GoT - Quick Go Templating
## Development Repository

Pretty simple tool that uses Go's text templating
http://golang.org/pkg/text/template/ to parse a source file and output a new
source file. I'm using it with "go generate" in at least one project
https://github.com/gholt/valuelocmap and it's pretty basic. Not sure if it'll
stand the test of time or if I need something else I just haven't found out
there yet.

This is the latest development area for the package.  
Eventually a stable version of the package will be established but, for now,
all things about this package are subject to change.
